🌱 Just starting my journey in automation, and I’m excited to share my first basic n8n project — an Appointment Calendar!

🛠️ What it does:
On form submission → checks condition → sends an appointment confirmation email automatically 📩
Even adds a small, personalized note (like wishing birthdays 🎉)

👉 It’s a simple project, but a great start for me in automation.
 Looking forward to learning more and building step by step 🚀

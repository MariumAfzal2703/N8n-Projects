âœ¨ Solving a real-world problem with n8n!

Recently, I tried one of n8n â€™s official real-world use cases and built a workflow where we automated:
ðŸ“¦ Fetching orders directly from the warehouse
ðŸ§® Calculating total booked orders and their total sum
ðŸ”Ž Identifying which orders are still in process
ðŸ“¢ Sending real-time updates to the team

This workflow is more than automation â€” itâ€™s a smart reporting system that helps teams:
âœ… Save time on manual tracking
âœ… Stay instantly updated on orders & performance
âœ… Make faster, data-driven decisions

It was exciting to see how quickly n8n can turn raw data into business insights
